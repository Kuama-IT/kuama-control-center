## Kuama Control Center

A handy tool to keep track of company resources, clients, projects and automate invoices and time reports.
Other example of questions this tool should be able to answer are:
- Has a given employee reported all the supposed hours for a given month?
- Are we earning or loosing money on a given project?
- How much will we spend this month on salaries?
- How much will we earn this month?
- Which employee has worked the most hours this month?
- Which employee has solved the most tickets this month?
- Which employee has pushed the most code this month?

All data (or most data) should be collected from external services, rather than being manually inputted.
